# Population-Growth
Lab 1 exercise for the CS50 course where the student has to calculate how long it takes for a population of llamas to reach a particular size.

The population of llamas (n) changes as such: 
  - Each year, n / 3 new llamas are born, and n / 4 llamas pass away.

The program works in this manner:
  - The user inputs the starting size of the population which needs to be greater than or equal to 9. 
  - Afterwards, the user inputs the final size of the population which needs to be greater than or equal     to the starting size.
  - At the end, the years that take for the population to reach the pre-given final size is shown.
